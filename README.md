# ItsVRKs-Game-Link-Motion-Profiles
Motion profiles for Game Link motion simulator software

## It doesn't matter how good the simulator is if you don't have a good motion profile!

"Einstein, in the special theory of relativity, proved that different observers, in different states of motion, see different realities." Leonard Susskind
