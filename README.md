# ItsVRKs-Game-Link-Motion-Profiles
Motion profiles for Game Link motion simulator software

## It doesn't matter how good the simulator is if you don't have a good motion profile!

"Einstein, in the special theory of relativity, proved that different observers, in different states of motion, see different realities." Leonard Susskind

## How to use

The simplest way to download these profiles is grab them all at once, to do this click on the green `Code` button at the towards the top right of github page, and select the `Download zip` link at the bottom of the popup.
